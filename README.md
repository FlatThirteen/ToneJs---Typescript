# TypeScript declarations file for ToneJs
These were originally pulled from https://github.com/Tonejs/TypeScript
but were very out of date and missing a package.json to put it in the
proper @types directory.  When this is fully updated, we can update back
to Tonejs as well as contribute to DefinitelyTyped.
